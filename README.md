## Overview

This repository contains descriptive documentation for the Java API in the [Battlecode 2018 competition](https://github.com/battlecode/bc18-scaffold).
Most of the descriptions comes directly from the Python API.

## Getting started
If you want your IDE to autocomplete for Battlecode's API, clone this repo and add the battlecode.jar file into your scaffold.
Next, add the jar file as a library. In IntelliJ, you can do this by going into File -> Project Structure -> Libraries.

## Editing Javadocs
If you want to edit the Javadocs, just go to [bc-javadocs-origin/bc](bc-javadocs-origin/bc) and edit the Javadocs directly.
You can then create a new battlecode.jar file by running `./create_jar.sh`.
